Techniques Classes: Hands-on instruction focusing on a specific culinary topic. While there are tasty samples to try during the class, the classes do not typically end in a meal. 

Menu-Based Classes: Students share in the preparation of the various dishes, finishing with a sit-down dinner. Try a Couples Cook version for you and your favorite cooking partner!
